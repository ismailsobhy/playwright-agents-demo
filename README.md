# Playwright Agents: Planner, Generator & Healer

In **October 2025**, Playwright introduced a highly structured and interactive approach to **AI-powered test automation** — the **Playwright Agents**.  
As described here: [Playwright Test Agents](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-agents)

Playwright Agents operate through a **three-stage collaborative workflow**:

1. 🧠 **Planner** – Discovers the website and produces a **Markdown test plan** with detailed scenarios.
2. ⚙️ **Generator** – Converts the Markdown test plan into **executable Playwright test files**.
3. 🔧 **Healer** – Runs the generated tests and **automatically fixes** failing tests.
